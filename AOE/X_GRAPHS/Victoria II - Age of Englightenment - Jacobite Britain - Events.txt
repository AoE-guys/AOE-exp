0. Britain Freed From Corruption - The Three Kingdoms 


Now that the legitimate rulers of these isles have been returned to their God-given place, we can begin to purge Whiggish corruption. The first way to do this both rewards loyal supporters and destroys the revolutionaries’ machinations of domination: We must burn the “Act of Union” and Penal Laws to free our dominions from the yoke of this odious parliament. The new king will rule as his ancestors did in the grand days of old: As King of England, Scotland and Ireland! Though the English Parliament will take more breaking, Scotland and England can now be given to their local lords for the more tedious domestic ruling. This constitutional setup will truly be the foundation for happiness!


Choice a) Very well, they’d do well to remember where King shall be ruling from though. 


Play as the Kingdom of England


Choice b) The just reward for our blood shed in his name. In My Defens God Me Defend.


Play as the Kingdom of Scotland


Choice c) Finally! Freedom! Mo Ghile Mear has not let us down!

EVTDESC156904;The general sejm is the bicameral parliament of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. It was established by the Union of Lublin in 1569 from the merger of the Sejm of the Kingdom of Poland and the Seimas of Grand Duchy of Lithuania, Ruthenia and Samogitia. It is one of the primary elements of the democratic governance in the Commonwealth . The sejm is a powerful political institution and the king could not pass laws without the approval of that body. This however has lead to our downfall, we cannot properly function as a nation anymore, no effective policies can be carried out becouse of our incompetent nobility! There is only one solution to this problem - a forcefull abolishment of our parliament!;;;;;;;;;;;;X,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;
mug_desc;With the support of the Islamic orthodoxy, a younger son of Shah Jahan, Aurangzeb (reigned 1658–1707), seized the throne. Aurangzeb defeated Dara in 1659 and had him executed. Although Shah Jahan fully recovered from his illness, Aurangzeb declared him incompetent to rule and had him imprisoned. During Aurangzeb's reign, the empire gained political strength once more and became the world's most powerful economy. Aurangzeb fully established sharia by compiling the Fatwa Alamgiri. He expanded the empire to include almost the whole of South Asia, but at his death in 1707, "many parts of the empire were in open revolt". Aurangzeb is considered India's most controversial king with some historians arguing his religious conservatism and intolerance undermined the stability of Mughal society, while other historians question this, noting that he built Hindu temples, employed significantly more Hindus in his imperial bureaucracy than his predecessors did, opposed bigotry against Hindus and Shia Muslims, and married Hindu Rajput princess Nawab Bai. Whithout him we cannot effectivly govern our empire anymore without resorting to granting more autonomy to diffrent states.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

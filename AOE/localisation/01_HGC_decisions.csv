support_january_uprising_desc;After Martial Law was declared, those designated for conscription secretly fled from Warsaw (Jan. 14–15, 1863), sought refuge in the nearby woodlands, and on January 22 issued a manifesto calling for a national insurrection. Although they were greatly outnumbered, poorly equipped, and successful in only a few engagements, the rebels gained support among the artisan, worker, lower gentry, and official classes in the cities and stimulated peasant revolts against the large landlords in rural areas. We could support this uprising against the Russians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;

russian_vladivostokSOV_desc;In July of 1860 the port of Vladivostok, or “Ruler of the East,” was founded near the Korean frontier.  It would become a major Russian trade port and shipbuilding yard. Eventually, it would become the focal point of an intercontinental railroad as well as a major scientific, cultural, and industrial center in its own right. The Czar dreamed that the city would become a hub connecting the west with the east. Perhaps the railroad to Vladivostok will eventually replace the Suez Canal as the bearer of goods and raw materials between the East and the West?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;X,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;

switch_to_early_russian_tech_desc;"Orthodoxy, Autocracy and Nationality, also known as Official Nationality was the dominant ideological doctrine of Russian emperor Nicholas I. ""The Triad"" of Official Nationality was originally proposed by Minister of Education Sergey Uvarov in his April 2, 1833 circular letter to subordinate educators. It was soon embraced by Nicholas and his establishment and gained wide public recognition, vocally supported by intellectuals like Mikhail Pogodin, Fyodor Tyutchev and Nikolay Gogol. Critics of the policy saw this principle as a call for Russification. Yet the very fact of its existence, being Russia's first statewide political ideology since the sixteenth century, indicated the nation's brewing transition to modernity.";;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This elite was divided into Slavophiles and Westernizers, according to their views on the path Russia should take in the future, and the social class they represented was called intelligentsia.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In the late 17th and early 18th centuries, in order to compensate for its lack of manpower and resources, Sweden strove for innovative ways to make a more effective army. The tactics of Caroleans differed from those of Western European soldiers in their greater reliance upon pikes, rapiers, bayonets, and offensive strategy, which helped them to be victorious, even when greatly outnumbered, in many important Swedish battles. The Carolean army is regarded as one of the most effective military forces of their time.;;;;;;;;;;;;X,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;

absolutist_indoctrination_title;" A monarch's interests are the same as the people's, because his political body is the same as his public body (the king's ""body"" is both his own natural body and the body of the state--the Leviathan). Contrastingly, in sovereign groups, the rulers do not share a body with the public. Secondly, a monarch will receive better counsel than aristocratic or democratic governors, because he can select experts and obtain their advice in private. Third, a monarch's policies will be more consistent because he is of one mind. Fourth, civil war is less likely in a monarchy because the monarch cannot disagree with himself. Finally, succession of sovereign power is more stable in a monarchy because the sovereign can choose his heir and the method of succession.";;;;;;;;;;;;X,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;

establish_ecole_militire_desc;"Founded in 1750 by King Louis XV, after the War of the Austrian Succession, on the basis of a proposal of Marshal Maurice de Saxe and with the support of Madame de Pompadour and financier Joseph Paris Duverney. Previously, military academies were exclusive to children of a noble background and offered apprenticeships in the King's Stables or the stables of other royal members. With the aim of creating an academic college for cadet officers from poor noble families, the exclusivity that royal military academies held vanished. By the edict of January 1751, King Louis XV founded the institution intended for the education of five hundred noble young men and born without fortune. Article XI of the edict provides for ""by way of first perpetual endowment"" the tax on playing cards. The administration is entrusted to the Secretary of State for War. The Royal Military Academy included a number of military colleges in the province such as the School of Brienne where students were admitted on evidence of nobility. At the end of their schooling, admission to the Royal Military School in Paris was done through a national competition.";;;;;;;;;;;;X,,,,,,,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;
